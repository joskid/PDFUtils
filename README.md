# PDFUtils
An open-source pdf based document application that will hopefully take back open source from Adobe.
## Building
To build run the appropriate script for your operating system/build environment and then run/open the build files with your tools.
This project uses premake, so if there is not an appropriate script, all you have to do is run the premake binary in vendor/bin/premake 
with the correct input file and build system name. You may have to download binaries for mac and linux, though.
